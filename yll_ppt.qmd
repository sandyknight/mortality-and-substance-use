- Years of life lost (YLL) is a measure of the impact of premature mortality, helpfully defined by Public Health England [here](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profile-for-england/definitions-regional.html#years-of-life-lost-yll).

- Chudasama et al. (2022) investigated five methods for estimating YLL.[^2] The first two methods are feasible with the available data for YLL from drug use and alcohol-specific deaths. Only the drug-related YLL could be segmented by geographical estimates of deprivation.

- All five methods are detailed in the supplementary PDF [here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0895435622001639-mmc1.pdf).

The crude expected years of life lost is:

$$
YLL = (D_x)(e_{x}^s)
$$

Where $D_x$ is the number of deaths and $e_{x}^s$ is the standard age of death from the external life expectancy.

```{r}
source("R/yll.R")
```

- Total YLL associated with drug use was `r yll_m1`. 

- For comparison, Heald et al. (2024)[^3] estimated the impact of obesity on YLL in England at 791,689 in 2019.

- Deaths at ages between 35 and 54 accounted for 60% of the YLL.

## YLL method II

Adding discounting and age-weighting. 

$$
Y_x = d_x \left[\frac{KCe^{r}(n^{a}x)}{(r + \beta)^2}(e^{z}[-(r+\beta)^{2}(e^{s}_{x} + a_{x}) - 1]) \right]
$$

[^4]
The discount rate ($r$) is based on the concept that future mortality outcomes
have less value than the present mortality outcomes. The discounting rate is a
continuous and exponential function, therefore the higher the discount rate,
the lower the impact is in the future. The usual time for the discounting rate
is set at 3% per year. Age weighting is used because it enables the YLL
equation to value differently at various ages, i.e. the value of years lived
by a young adult could be noted to be worth more than that of a very young or
an old individual. So, the parameters were estimated at $C=0.1658$ and $\beta=0.04$
to account for this, which was calibrated and chosen from the 1990 GBD
study.
