# Years of life lost due to substance use 


Years of life lost (YLL) is a measure of the impact of premature mortality, helpfully defined by Public Health England [here](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profile-for-england/definitions-regional.html#years-of-life-lost-yll)

Chudasama et al. (2022) investigated five methods for estimating YLL[^1]. The first two methods are feasible with the available data for YLL from drug use and alcohol specific deaths. Only the drug-related YLL could be segmented by geographical estimates of deprivation.

All five methods are detailed in the supplementary PDF [here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0895435622001639-mmc1.pdf).

### Mortality data
- Deaths related to drug misuse as defined by the ONS[^2].
- Additional drugs related to drugs misuse that the ONS had insufficient data to classify, but can be inferred from the data linkage of ONS data with NDTMS data by project BOLD [^2].
- Alcohol specific deaths
