# Premature mortality and subtstance use
- Ask 1: What proportion of premature deaths, given a cutoff point e.g. 55, are due to drugs and alcohol.  
- Ask 2: Years of life lost (YLL) as a measure of premature mortality 
*NB: ask Chioma for alcohol-specific deaths data by age and maybe LA.* 
- Ask 3: Add IMD to all of this - preferably by lower levels check feasibility first 

## 1. Proportion of deaths

Original email instructions from JK:

> Is deaths during and after treatment that not poisonings (or alc specific) but will be in a large part due to drug or alcohol use. So once you have worked out the total number of poisoning deaths 

> Using the data in the toolkit on the beta site can you add in the other opiate deaths of other causes not poisoning for those that died in treatment in the year you are looking at. Then the same for non-opiates and lastly the same for alcohol excluding alc specific deaths that you will have got from the alc specific data– you should be able to get the age for all of these which is why you need to use the beta site. 

> Can you also then add in the people that have died one year after leaving treatment – using the year before and selecting the treatment status of one year post (we can assume that these are also all drug and alc related being so close to their treatment date) 

> Can you split out each different cohort and component you are adding so we can see how much each one adds. 

> Lastly with we will need to then apply similar rates of all cause mortality to opiate users outside of treatment but lets do all the above first and then discuss. 
  

Latest email instructions from JK:

> Morning – this has gone in for the 18th. If possible it would be really good to have some of the premature mortality stuff available to discuss at the meeting. So could you focus first on updating the work that estimates the total number of drug and alcohol deaths by age (with drugs separate, alcohol separate and then combined) and then what % of total deaths in each age range (and overall under 50) are a result of either of the three substance group above. 

> It would also be good to have an overall breakdown of how we have arrived at the total number of drug and alcohol deaths. i.e. DRDs + non DRD drug users in treatment + non DRDs drugs users left treatment but died in the year following etc. 

> Lastly if there is time would be good to have the outputs by deprivation

> Hopefully you have all you need for this but happy to dig out some of the original specs if helpful. Let me know. 

> If you can finish this in time then can look at LYL but I think the above is probably more useful for that conversation. 



## 2. Years of life lost due to substance use  

Years of life lost (YLL) is a measure of the impact of premature mortality, helpfully defined by Public Health England [here](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profile-for-england/definitions-regional.html#years-of-life-lost-yll)

Chudasama et al. (2022) investigated five methods for estimating YLL[^1]. The first two methods are feasible with the available data for YLL from drug use and alcohol specific deaths. Only the drug-related YLL could be segmented by geographical estimates of deprivation.

All five methods are detailed in the supplementary PDF [here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0895435622001639-mmc1.pdf).

### Mortality data
- Deaths related to drug misuse as defined by the ONS[^2].
- Additional drugs related to drugs misuse that the ONS had insufficient data to classify, but can be inferred from the data linkage of ONS data with NDTMS data by [Better Outcomes through Linked data (BOLD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-justice-better-outcomes-through-linked-data-bold) [^2].
- Alcohol specific deaths
