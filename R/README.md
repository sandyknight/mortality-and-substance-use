# Premature mortality and subtstance use
- Ask 1: What proportion of premature deaths, given a cutoff point e.g. 55, are due to drugs and alcohol.  
- Ask 2: Years of life lost (YLL) as a measure of premature mortality 
*NB: ask Chioma for alcohol-specific deaths data by age and maybe LA.* 
- Ask 3: Add IMD to all of this - preferably by lower levels check feasibility first 

## 1. Proportion of deaths




## 2. Years of life lost due to substance use  

Years of life lost (YLL) is a measure of the impact of premature mortality, helpfully defined by Public Health England [here](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profile-for-england/definitions-regional.html#years-of-life-lost-yll)

Chudasama et al. (2022) investigated five methods for estimating YLL[^1]. The first two methods are feasible with the available data for YLL from drug use and alcohol specific deaths. Only the drug-related YLL could be segmented by geographical estimates of deprivation.

All five methods are detailed in the supplementary PDF [here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0895435622001639-mmc1.pdf).

### Mortality data
- Deaths related to drug misuse as defined by the ONS[^2].
- Additional drugs related to drugs misuse that the ONS had insufficient data to classify, but can be inferred from the data linkage of ONS data with NDTMS data by [Better Outcomes through Linked data (BOLD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-justice-better-outcomes-through-linked-data-bold) [^2].
- Alcohol specific deaths
